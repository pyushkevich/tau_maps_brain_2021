# Scripts for building a 3D atlas of tau burden from MRI and histology

These scripts accompany the 2020 Yushkevich et al. submission to the journal Brain, titled "Three-Dimensional Mapping of Neurofibrillary Tangle Burden in the Human Medial Temporal Lobe". They capture the state of the repository at the time of the paper submission, December 11, 2021. 

The scripts continue to be modified and documented as the project evolves. We recommend looking into the main repository https://github.com/pyushkevich/tau_recon_scripts for the latest code and improved documentation.
